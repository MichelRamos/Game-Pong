# Game-Pong
Game Pong, developed using Java language and the Eclipse IDE.
The objective was to develop a Pong game that looked (and felt) as close as possible to the first Pong game released, back in 1972.
Some of the graphics look better since the original graphics were a consequence of the tecnology at the time, which was a limiting factor back then, rather than a design option.
The game was coded to give the user/player as much freedom as possible to change its features, from the speed of the ball to how well the AI will play.
You can use this code as you want, no mention needed.
